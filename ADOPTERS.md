Previous testing methods were basically done from the user’s perspective, while chaos engineering was done from the system’s perspective.

| Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC)            | 2019 | [link](https://www.icbc.com.cn/ICBC/EN/default.htm)           | Layer fault injection is jointly implemented based on "self-developed components + chaosblade components". By abstractly encapsulating the underlying capabilities, it provides applications with three categories of fault simulation capabilities: system, application, and container. Currently, it has been stably used in more than 400 large and small ICBC projects. In the application, it supports various fault scenarios such as upstream and downstream timeouts, database access timeouts, CPU/memory surges, IO read and write exceptions, etc.                                                                                                                                                   |
