Previous testing methods were basically done from the user’s perspective, while chaos engineering was done from the system’s perspective. Test to reduce failure recurrence rate |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Leveraging the powerful underlying capabilities of Chaosblade, we have built different business capabilities at the upper layer. The main aspects include:<br/> ● Infrastructure practice: This mainly involves creating machine-level abnormalities to simulate the system's fault tolerance when encountering large-scale failures in data centers or business machines.<br/> ● Strong and weak dependency practice: This involves injecting faults into the system by simulating traffic in production, and using monitoring and custom exceptions to assert the strong and weak dependency relationships between the application and its dependencies. The practice results are then compiled into reports to drive the governance of unreasonable strong dependencies, thereby improving overall stability in production.<br/> ● Attack and defense practice: This involves injecting specified exceptions into the system by simulating traffic in production, aiming to make the simulated exceptions as similar as possible to real-world exceptions. It helps to train developers' ability to handle sudden failures and improve the speed of fault localization and resolution. |

With ChaosBlade's support for hardware base scenarios, Docker scenarios, K8S scenarios, and network scenarios at multiple levels of granularity, we have quantified the product's high availability capabilities; identified potential stability risks; enhanced the stability of the service business products; and provided a reliable and flexible chaos experiment solution.                                                                  |
